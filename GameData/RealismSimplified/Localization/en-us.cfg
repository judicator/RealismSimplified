Ever since the X-33 and Venture Star program of the 1990s was aborted only a few years years before the leaking problems that had killed Venture Star were solved, space companies have been trying to justify the very high cost of composite materials. Although costs continue to drop, the intensive manufacturing process is still very expensive, requiring the wrapping and weaving of hundreds of layers of carbon fiber with resins that are then baked off in massive autoclaves. Currently, the only rocket to use composite materials is the smallsat Electron orbital launcher developed by Rocket Lab.<br><color=#ffffb4>Source: RealismOverhaul</color>

Due to the engine's potential advantage in specific impulse, if this F-1B configuration (using four F-1Bs in total) were integrated with the SLS Block 2, the vehicle could deliver 150 tonnes to low Earth orbit, while 113 tonnes is what is regarded as achievable with the planned solid boosters combined with a four-engine RS-25 core stage<br>The F-1B engine has a design goal to be at least as powerful as the unflown F-1A, while also being more cost effective.

The engine's preliminary design dates back to recommendations of the 1959 Silverstein Committee. Rocketdyne won approval to develop the J-2 in June 1960 and the first flight, AS-201, occurred on 26 February 1966. The J-2 underwent several minor upgrades over its operational history to improve the engine's performance, with two major upgrade programs, the de Laval nozzle-type J-2S and aerospike-type J-2T, which were cancelled after the conclusion of the Apollo program.<br>Five J-2 engines were used on the Saturn V's S-II second stage, and one J-2 was used on the S-IVB upper stage used on both the Saturn IB and Saturn V.

The main change to the original J-2 design was a change from the gas generator cycle to a tap-off cycle that supplied hot gas from a tap on the combustion chamber instead of a separate burner. In addition to removing parts from the engine, it also reduced the difficulty of starting up the engine and properly timing various combustors. Additional changes included a throttling system for wider mission flexibility, which also required a variable mixture system to properly mix the fuel and oxygen for a variety of different operating pressures. It also included a new \"Idle Mode\" that produced little thrust for on-orbit maneuvering or to settle the fuel tanks on-orbit prior to a burn.<br>During the experimental program, Rocketdyne also produced a small run of six pre-production models for testing, the J-2S. These were test fired many times between 1965 and 1972, for a total of 30,858 seconds burn time. In 1972 it became clear no follow-on orders for Saturn boosters were coming, and the program shut down.

Rocketdyne provided the injector system, at the request of NASA, when Bell could not solve combustion instability problems.<br>During the spring of 1963, Grumman hired Bell to develop the lunar module ascent engine, on the assumption that Bell's experience in development of the Air Force Agena engine would be transferable to the lunar module requirements. Grumman placed heavy emphasis upon high reliability through simplicity of design, and the ascent engine emerged as the least complicated of the three main engines in the Apollo space vehicle, including the LM descent and CSM service propulsion system engines. Embodying a pressure-fed fuel system using hypergolic (self-igniting) propellants, the ascent engine was fixed-thrust and nongimbaled, capable of lifting the ascent stage off the Moon or aborting a landing if necessary.<br>The engine developed about 16 kN of thrust, which produced a velocity of 2,000 meters per second from lunar launch, to LOR, and CM docking.<br><color=#ffffb4>Source: Wikipedia</color>

Elverum Jr. and developed by Space Technology Laboratories (TRW) for use in the Apollo Lunar Module descent stage. It used Aerozine 50 fuel and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) oxidizer. This engine used a pintle injector, which paved the way for other engines to use similar designs.<br>The propulsion system for the descent stage of the lunar module was designed to transfer the vehicle, containing two crewmen, from a 110 km circular lunar parking orbit to an elliptical descent orbit with a pericynthion of 15,000 m, then provide a powered descent to the lunar surface, with hover time above the lunar surface to select the exact landing site. To accomplish these maneuvers, a propulsion system was developed that used hypergolic propellants and a gimballed pressure-fed ablative cooled engine that was capable of being throttled. The exhaust nozzle extension was designed to crush without damaging the LM if it struck the surface, which happened on Apollo 15. To keep the DPS as simple, lightweight, and reliable as possible, the propellants were pressure-fed with helium gas instead of using heavy, complicated, and failure-prone turbopumps.<br>The LMDE achieved a prominent role in the Apollo 13 mission, serving as the primary propulsion engine after the oxygen tank explosion in the Apollo Service Module. After this event, the ground controllers decided that the Service Propulsion System could no longer be operated safely, leaving the DPS engine in Aquarius as the only means of maneuvering Apollo 13.<br><color=#ffffb4>Source: Wikipedia</color>

The pair of LR-101 vernier thrusters would receive their propellant flow from the turbopumps of the sustainer engine until it was shut off. After sustainer burnout, this pair of thrusters would switch to feed off the remaining propellant, effectively becoming a Pressure-fed engine.

Although NERVA engines were built and tested as much as possible with flight-certified components and the engine was deemed ready for integration into a spacecraft, they never flew in space. Plans for deep space exploration generally require the power of nuclear rocket engines, and all spacecraft concepts featuring them use derivative designs from the NERVA.<br><color=#ffffb4>Source: Wikipedia</color>

It was used in second stage of Kosmos-2 (R-12) launch vehicle. RD-119 has a huge expansion ratio on the nozzle and uses a unique propellant combination to achieve an extremely high isp of 352 s for a semi-cryogenic gas-generator engine. It also has a unique steering mechanism. The engine main nozzle is fixed, and the output of the gas generator is fed into four nozzles on the side of the engine. Instead of using gimbaled verniers to supply vector control, the combustion gases are distributed by an electrically driven system that can control the thrust among the nozzles.<br>Between 1958 and 1960, Glushko's OKB 456 developed the RD-109 for the Block-I of the 8K73 project — a liquid-oxygen/UDMH version of the R-7. But Korolev refusal to use such a toxic combination shelved the project. When Yangel's OKB-586 was tasked with developing a launch vehicle out of the R-12, they had to develop an upper stage from scratch. The critical issue was the low specific impulse of the first stage, and thus a very high-efficiency upper-stage engine was needed. For this Glushko offered to adapt the RD-109, and Yangel accepted the proposal. It flew some very important missions on the Kosmos-2 launch vehicle, with about 165 engines produced.<br><color=#ffffb4>Source: Wikipedia</color>
